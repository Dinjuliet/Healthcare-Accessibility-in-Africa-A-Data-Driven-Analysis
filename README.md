# Healthcare-Accessibility-in-Africa-A-Data-Driven-Analysis
# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project explores healthcare accessibility in Africa using Power BI. The goal is to analyze disparities between rural and urban healthcare facilities, evaluate funding efficiency, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve healthcare service delivery.

# DATASET DETAILS

The dataset consists of healthcare facility data categorized into:

📍 Rural vs. Urban Healthcare Disparities – Facility distribution, number of doctors & nurses, and patient accessibility.

👩‍⚕️ Healthcare Workforce Availability – Number of doctors & nurses per facility across different regions.

🏥 Patient Accessibility & Utilization – Patient visits, distance to facilities, and emergency response times.

💰 Funding & Resource Allocation – Funding per facility, electricity & internet access.

📈 Patient Satisfaction & Healthcare Outcomes – Service quality based on patient feedback & emergency response efficiency.

[Overview of Healthcare Accessibility in Africa] (![Screenshot 2025-04-01 202517](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c08c7f9-ae03-4258-9fed-d070ba29e304)(![Screenshot 2025-04-01 202608](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3f5a6b2-3fa2-4575-a590-5a0d0fb13de8)

# KEY FINDINGS

🏥 Healthcare Facility Distribution

✔️ Rural areas: 1,873 facilities (647 clinics, 642 health centers, 584 hospitals).

✔️ Urban areas: 127 facilities (49 clinics, 37 health centers, 41 hospitals).

➡️ Insight: Rural regions have more facilities, but their vast geography and infrastructure challenges make access difficult.

💰 Funding Disparities

✔️ Rural areas receive $199M, while urban areas receive only $14M.

➡️ Insight: Despite higher funding in rural areas, challenges like infrastructure gaps and workforce shortages limit service quality.

🚑 Emergency Response Time

✔️ Rural: 32 minutes

✔️ Urban: 33 minutes

➡️ Insight: Funding alone doesn’t improve emergency response times. Factors like ambulance availability, road conditions, and facility locations play a critical role.

👨‍⚕️ Workforce Challenges

✔️ Rural regions have more healthcare staff, but urban areas still struggle with lower doctor-to-patient ratios.

➡️ Insight: Urban areas need better workforce distribution to balance patient demand.

⚡ Infrastructure & Technology

✔️ Urban facilities have better electricity & internet access, enabling better telemedicine & digital healthcare solutions.

➡️ Insight: Improving rural infrastructure is key to ensuring equitable healthcare access.

# ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

✅ Improve Funding Allocation – Target funding towards ambulance services, road networks, and workforce training.

✅ Expand Telemedicine – Increase digital healthcare access in rural areas through internet expansion.

✅ Optimize Workforce Distribution – Provide incentives for healthcare professionals to work in underserved areas.

✅ Enhance Emergency Response – Invest in more ambulances & faster transport networks.

# 🛠 TECHNOLOGIES USDED

📊 Power BI – Data visualization & insights generation.
